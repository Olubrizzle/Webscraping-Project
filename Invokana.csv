I would like to offer some advice that may be helpful. Along with my invokana (300 mg.) and metformin (1000 mg. twice a day) I also take a probiotic female supplement called ""RepHresh Pro-B"" . It's a little pricey, ($29.99) at Walmart, for a 30 day supply but it well worth it in my opinion! I've been on invokana for over 30 days and have taken this supplement from day 1 along with it because I saw reviews about getting yeast infections. I haven't had this problem yet and hope it stays that way! I also eat yogurt twice a day. Hope this helps! ",1 to 6 months
