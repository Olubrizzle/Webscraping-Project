Instead, I had no symtoms except for losing weight and frequent urination. I immediately had a massive change in diet, and started walking 4-8 miles a day. My doctor started my on the Metformin with two 500 mg tabs a day, taken at dinner. I have seen my blood glucose readings drop from 270 down to 90 within the past two weeks. I've dropped 44 pounds, (the last 15-20 have been from the diet and exercise), and even my blood pressure haas fallen 20 points. I have experience no side effects at all from the Metformin. None. No diarrhea, no nausea, no feeling of being tired...nothing. So I guess you could say that I love the stuff. I don't know how far my A1C readings have fallen yet, as I haven't had that retested yet. But imagine that they are well on their way to coming into the tolerance range. In addition to good food (no sugar, lots of veggies, lean meats, whole grains, a few almonds for snacking, etc.), my doctor also recommended that I use the Adkins products to supplement my diet when needed. I find the ""treats"" such as the low-carb desserts are an acceptable way to satisfy my cravings when the sweet tooth calls.

Much more fiber and fruits and veggies. I take 500mg 2x a day. I also take amaryl 2mg twice a day. I've noticed that stomach upset is much less severe if you take med with milk. A couple swallows before the pills helps to coat your stomach. I can not take this with water. Always heard to take diabetes meds a half hour before eating, but not this med. You have to take this with milk or with food, otherwise it will make you have a very upset stomach. If you can't do the milk, start the meal. Take the med after eating a few bites. You need to coat your stomach. This simple thing will help reduce stomach discomfort. If you eat a lot of fatty foods you will have more diarrhea problems. Been taking since 9-12-11. blood sugar 14 day average is down to 110. 30 day average is 126. I do notice some sweating issues when I eat. Maybe just a spike in blood sugar levels. Try to take med 10 to 12 hours apart. Eat lunch. If you take this to late in evening you may have lowered blood sugars to the point of needing to eat something. with me, its a 4 hour window, almost like some people on insulin. This drug hits me big time about 4 hours after I take it. Pay attention to what you eat. Moderation is the key to life. don't eat the whole cake, maybe not even a whole large slice, a few bites can be wonderful. Keep juice or milk or candy handy in case you bottom out and need to raise your sugar levels. Good luck all. Diabetes is a monster.",Male,55-64,"

I was told alot about it was caused by my diabetes, it's Retrograde ejaculation because of the diabetes the nerves in the neck of the bladder are effected and the seman backs into the bladder. Well with my readin g about the drug on Web MD I found the Metformin causes very serious dehydration. My blood  suger has been in the 90's and stayed there after cutting Metformin down to 1 500mg tab a day and drinking lots of water. The ejaculation problem went completly away, gone.
